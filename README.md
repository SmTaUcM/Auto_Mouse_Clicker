#  Auto Mouse Clicker
A Python program that repeatedly clicks the mouse for a given time. Admittedly used to cheat while playing a game with my daughter.

- **Description:** A Program that will repeatedly press/click a given button for a given delay. The program can also be started, stopped and resumed by pressing 'S' and the
                   program will terminate if you press 'E'.  

- **What I Learned:** This project taught me more about how to implement  threading when using Python as well as an alternative method for sending and detecting key presses.
